### Project 0 description
Predicts a guessed number using as few as possible attempts. In average, the algorithm predicats the number after 6 attempts.

**Conditions**
- The computer generates random integer number in a range from 0 to 100. 
- The number prediction algorythm starts guessing from 50 and gradually changes its prediction. 
- The algorithm also counts the number of attempts, and returns the average number of successful guesses after 1000 passes.


### Project 1 description
It was analized the client outflow from a certain bank. The dataset is available on Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers). The result is presented in a jupiter notebook format in 10 figures with explanations, namely:
- Fig.1 - customer distribution by bank usage status (client/not a client);
- Fig.2 - all customer's accounts by balabce, exceeding 2500 dollars;
- Fig.3 - gone client's accounts distribution by balance;
- Fig.4 - hone clients by age groups;
- Fig.5 - customers by credit score and estimated salary;
- Fig.6 - gone clients by gender;
- Fig.7 - gone clients by the number of products;
- Fig.8 - customers by the 'active client' status;
- Fig.9 - gone clients by country;
